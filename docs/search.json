    "text": "Finding Blissey\nDuring my initial exploration of the data I made the following plot: one that shows the relationship between a Pokémon’s attack and defense stats while also showing their base experience. (Remember: base experience is the amount of experience yielded from a Pokémon’s defeat in battle).\n\nggplot(pokemon, aes(x = attack, y = defense)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = base_experience)) +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  scale_colour_viridis_c(option = \"mako\", direction = -1) +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey80\"),\n    text = element_text(family = \"serif\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.75)),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.75))) +\n  labs(title = \"Defense vs. Attack by Base Experience\",\n       x = \"Attack Stat\", \n       y = \"Defense Stat\", \n       colour = \"Base Experience\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first, nothing looked out of the ordinary; attack and defense had a positive relationship and as they both increased, so did the experience yielded. This makes sense because as the game progresses, the Pokémon get stronger (their stats increase), which means the player is rewarded more significantly for defeating them (their base experience increases). Then I noticed something odd:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very dark dot (circled above) indicating a Pokémon with very high base experience close to the minimum values for defense and attack. This was very intriguing to me, as it is odd that a Pokémon that does not deal significant damage or lower received damage would be considered such a difficult opponent to net so much experience.\nUpon further investigation, I found that this Pokémon is Blissey, a normal type Pokémon introduced in the second generation of the Pokémon games that is always female.\n\npokemon_bliss |&gt; select(c(\"id\", \"pokemon\", \"base_experience\", \"type_1\", \"hp\", \"attack\", \"defense\", \"generation_id\")) |&gt; knitr::kable()\n\nWhat makes Blissey interesting is her hp.\n\nggplot(pokemon, aes(y = hp)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  labs(y = \"Health\") +\n  geom_point(data = pokemon_bliss, aes(x = 0), color = \"hotpink\") +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey80\"),\n    text = element_text(family = \"serif\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows that Blissey (marked in pink) has the highest health of any Pokémon in the data set. Her close second is her pre-evolved form, Chansey, and all other close competitors are acheived in the late game and are generally more well-rounded than Blissey. Blissey is the unique “tank” Pokémon in the franchise, meaning that her primary purpose to take hits and survive, not to deal damage."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIt is important to note that this data set only contains Pokémon from Generations 1 through 7. This means that the most recent games and their Pokémon are not represented. It is possible that Blissey has been dethroned in the newest Generations. With more time and more complex data, I would have liked to analyze Blissey’s move set, especially in the context of knowing her as a tank Pokémon."

I will note that my boxplot is quite squished, but because I was focusing on an outlier rather than the spread, I feel it is reasonable."
