    "text": "Finding Blissey\nDuring my initial exploration of the data I made the following plot: one that shows the relationship between a Pokémon’s attack and defense stats while also showing their base experience. (Remember: base experience is the amount of experience yielded from a Pokémon’s defeat in battle).\n\nggplot(pokemon, aes(x = attack, y = defense)) +\n  geom_point(aes(colour = base_experience)) +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  scale_colour_viridis_c(option = \"mako\", direction = -1) +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey80\"),\n    text = element_text(family = \"serif\"),\n    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.75)),\n    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.75))) +\n  labs(title = \"Defense vs. Attack by Base Experience\",\n       x = \"Attack Stat\", \n       y = \"Defense Stat\", \n       colour = \"Base Experience\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first, nothing looked out of the ordinary; attack and defense had a positive relationship and as they both increased, so did the experience yielded. This makes sense because as the game progresses, the Pokémon get stronger (their stats increase), which means the player is rewarded more significantly for defeating them (their base experience increases). Then I noticed something odd:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA very dark dot (circled above) indicating a Pokémon with very high base experience close to the minimum values for defense and attack. This was very intriguing to me, as it is odd that a Pokémon that does not deal significant damage or lower received damage would be considered such a difficult opponent to net so much experience.\nUpon further investigation, I found that this Pokémon is Blissey, a normal type Pokémon introduced in the second generation of the Pokémon games that is always female.\n\npokemon_bliss |&gt; select(c(\"id\", \"pokemon\", \"base_experience\", \"type_1\", \"hp\", \"attack\", \"defense\", \"generation_id\")) |&gt; knitr::kable()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nid\npokemon\nbase_experience\ntype_1\nhp\nattack\ndefense\ngeneration_id\n\n\n\n\n242\nblissey\n608\nnormal\n255\n10\n10\n2\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes Blissey interesting is her hp.\n\nggplot(pokemon, aes(y = hp)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  theme_linedraw() +\n  labs(y = \"Health\") +\n  geom_point(data = pokemon_bliss, aes(x = 0), color = \"hotpink\") +\n  theme(\n    panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"grey80\"),\n    text = element_text(family = \"serif\"),\n    axis.text.x = element_blank(),\n    axis.title.x = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above plot shows that Blissey (marked in pink) has the highest health of any Pokémon in the data set. Her close second is her pre-evolved form, Chansey, and all other close competitors are acheived in the late game and are generally more well-rounded than Blissey. Blissey is the unique “tank” Pokémon in the franchise, meaning that her primary purpose to take hits and survive, not to deal damage."

It is possible that Blissey has been dethroned in the newest Generations. With more time and more complex data, I would have liked to analyze Blissey’s move set, especially in the context of knowing her as a tank Pokémon."

    "text": "Africa (not by Toto)\nThis plot confirmed my earlier judgement from the map, that Africa has the most language diversity within this dataset. This motivated me to continue my investigation of Africa and it’s languages, so I narrowed in my initial map on Africa, this time coloring by language family (with the top ten most common families in Africa being separate and all others falling into the “other” category).\n\nafrica &lt;- world_map |&gt; filter(lat &lt; 38 & lat &gt; -34, long &gt; -18 & long &lt; 51)\n\nlanguages_africa &lt;- languages |&gt; filter(macroarea == \"Africa\")\n\nlanguages_africa &lt;- left_join(languages_africa, families, join_by(family_id == id))\n\nafrica_topten &lt;- languages_africa |&gt; group_by(family_id) |&gt; summarise(n_languages = n()) |&gt; arrange(desc(n_languages)) |&gt; slice(1:10)\n\nlanguages_africa &lt;- languages_africa |&gt; mutate(new_family = \n                                                 if_else((family_id %in% africa_topten$family_id), family, \"other\")) \n\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = africa,\n            mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group), fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  geom_point(data = languages_africa, aes(y = latitude, x = longitude, color = new_family), size = .75) +\n  coord_map(\"mercator\") +\n  xlim(c(-20, 52)) +\n  ylim(c(-40, 40)) +\n  labs(color = \"Family\", title = \"Language Families in Africa\")\n\nWarning: Removed 35 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis map provides some interesting insights. Firstly, we can see that the most dominant language family is, by far, the Atlantic-Congo family. We can also see that, for the most part, languages from the same families are clustered together. Finally, notice that the most common family in the Northern part of the continent is Afro-Asiatic, which makes sense based on its proximity to Asia.\nI have heard of quite a few African languages, but nowhere near this number, so, naturally my next motivation was to investigate the “status” of these languages. Are they mostly endangered or even extinct? The following map uses the same strategy as above but colors for status rather than families.\n\nlanguages_africa2 &lt;- left_join(languages_africa, endangered_status, join_by(id == id))\n\nggplot() +\n  geom_polygon(data = africa,\n            mapping = aes(x = long, y = lat,\n                          group = group), fill = \"white\", color = \"black\") +\n  theme_void() +\n  geom_point(data = languages_africa2, aes(y = latitude, x = longitude, color = status_label), size = .75) +\n  coord_map(\"mercator\") +\n  xlim(c(-20, 52)) +\n  ylim(c(-40, 40)) +\n  labs(color = \"Status\", title = \"Statuses of Languages in Africa\")\n\nWarning: Removed 35 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph shows that the majority of the languages in Africa are not endangered! This was very surprising to me, especially given the second most common status among these languages is threatened rather than one of the statuses closer to extinct. I was also a bit surprised to see that, for the most part, languages in similar statuses are not clustered together, I wouldn’t have been surprised if colonization of Africa had caused many languages in some areas to go extinct, but there is little evidence of spatial patterns."

It is interesting to me that the data shows such an obvious wealth of linguistic intrigue in Africa, but current research efforts and cultural exchanges are not, to my knowledge, prioritizing this area. I am sure that these many language communities hold fascinating phenomenon the linguists could learn from.\nOne possible limitation of my data is the way in which I have distinguished “African” languages. I have relied on the macroarea variable in the dataset, which seems to be accurate, but I have also, for ease of exploration, excluded any languages from more than one macroarea. These languages would have been more difficult to plot on the map, and are less inline with my research question than Africa-unique languages. Given more time, I would’ve liked to use the is_isolate variable to explore languages without families."
