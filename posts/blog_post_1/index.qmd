## Introduction

For this post, I worked with a data set of 949 Pokemon, accessed from TidyTuesday \_\_\_\_\_.

I began with a simple question in mind: which Pokemon should be my new favorite? During my initial exploration of the data I made the following graph: one that shows the relationship between a Pokemon's attack stat and defense stat while showing the experience yielded from defeating this Pokemon in battle. At first,

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
library(ggplot2)

pokemon <- read_csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/main/data/2025/2025-04-01/pokemon_df.csv')

```

```{r}
ggplot(pokemon, aes(x = attack, y = defense)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = base_experience)) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  scale_colour_viridis_c(option = "mako", direction = -1) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey80"),
    text = element_text(family = "serif"),
    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.75)),
    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.75))) +
  labs(title = "Placeholder",
       x = "Attack Stat", 
       y = "Defense Stat", 
       colour = "Experience Yielded")
```

```{r}
pokemon_bliss <- pokemon |> filter(pokemon == "blissey")

ggplot(pokemon, aes(x = attack, y = defense)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = base_experience)) +
  geom_point(data = pokemon_bliss, shape = 1, size = 5) +
  theme_linedraw() +
  scale_colour_viridis_c(option = "mako", direction = -1) +
  theme(
    panel.background = element_rect(fill = "grey80"),
    text = element_text(family = "serif"),
    legend.title = element_text(size = rel(0.75)),
    legend.text = element_text(size = rel(0.75))) +
  labs(title = "Placeholder",
       x = "Attack Stat", 
       y = "Defense Stat", 
       colour = "Experience Yielded")
```
